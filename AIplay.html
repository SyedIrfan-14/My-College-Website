        An "AI Treasure Hunt" could refer to a game or competition that involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI)
        techniques to solve challenges or puzzles in order to locate hidden treasures or rewards. This concept combines
        elements of AI, problem-solving, and exploration.

      <p class="innercont-p">Round 1 : Squid Game :: Red Light - Green Light.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        "Red Light, Green Light" is a popular children's game, and there aren't strict official rules or regulations.
        However, here are the general guidelines for playing the game:
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">*Objective:* The objective of the game is to advance as far as possible toward a designated
        finish line without getting caught by the "it" player.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">*Setup:*
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">1. Choose one player to be the "it" or "stoplight" player.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">2. The "it" player stands at a distance from the other players, facing away from them.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">3. The remaining players stand in a line some distance behind the "it" player, forming a
        starting line.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">*Gameplay:*
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">1. The "it" player calls out "Green Light!" and turns away from the other players.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">2. While the "it" player has their back turned, the other players try to advance toward the
        finish line as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">3. At any point, the "it" player can call out "Red Light!" and quickly turn around to face
        the other players.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">4. When "Red Light" is called, all the other players must freeze immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">5. The "it" player then scans the frozen players. If they catch anyone moving, that player
        is out and must return to the starting line.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">6. The game continues with the "it" player alternately calling "Green Light" and "Red
        Light" until one player successfully reaches the finish line or until all players are caught.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">*Winning:*
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">The player who reaches the finish line first without getting caught by the "it" player wins
        the game. If all players are caught before reaching the finish line, the "it" player wins and can become the new
        "it" player for the next round.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">These are the basic rules, but you can modify them to suit your group's preferences. It's a
        fun and active game that can be adapted for different age groups and settings.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">Round 2 : Quick Buzzer!
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        The rules and regulations for an AI Buzzer round where participants act like AI can vary depending on the
        context and event. However, here are some general guidelines that you can consider:
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">English is Mandatory
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">1. Time Limit: Set a specific time limit for each participant to act like an AI. This
        ensures that the round doesn't drag on too long.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        2. Topics or Scenarios: Provide participants with predefined topics or scenarios related to artificial
        intelligence. This can include tasks like answering questions, providing recommendations, or simulating human-AI
        interactions.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        3. Buzzer System: Use a buzzer system to keep the round competitive. Participants should buzz in to perform
        their AI act, and the first one to do so gets the opportunity.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">4. Judging Criteria: Establish clear judging criteria for evaluating the participants' AI
        performances. Criteria could include accuracy, relevance, creativity, and how well they emulate AI behavior.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">5. Role-Playing: Encourage participants to fully immerse themselves in the role of AI. They
        should speak and respond in a manner consistent with how an AI might behave in the given scenario.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">6. Penalties: Consider implementing penalties for participants who break character or fail
        to follow the established rules. This helps maintain the integrity of the round.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">7. Audience Engagement: Depending on the event, involve the audience in the judging
        process. They can participate by providing feedback or even voting for their favorite AI performance.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">8. Host or Moderator: Appoint a host or moderator to keep the round organized, enforce the
        rules, and ensure a smooth flow of the competition.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">9. Prizes: Offer prizes or recognition for the best AI performances to incentivize active
        participation and competitiveness.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">10. Fairness: Ensure that all participants have equal opportunities and access to the
        buzzer system to prevent any bias.
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        Remember that the specific rules and regulations can be customized to suit the nature of the event and the
        preferences of the organizers. The goal is to create an engaging and entertaining AI Buzzer round for both
        participants and the audience.
